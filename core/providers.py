"""Payment provider connection.

The app never holds money. A payments provider (an account the owner opens and funds from his bank) holds it and sends it.
This module is the single place where a provider plugs in:

  * "manual"  - built in. The app builds ABA files and PayID/BPAY instruction lists; the owner sends them from his bank.
  * any other - needs an adapter registered with @register("name") that implements check() and send(release).
                Credentials are entered in Security and Settings > Payment provider and stored in data/secrets.env.

Adapters are written against the provider's own documentation and tested in the provider's sandbox first.
